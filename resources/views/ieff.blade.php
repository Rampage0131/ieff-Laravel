				<h3>Words of the spokesperson</h3>
			</div>

			<div class="row col-mb-50">
				<div class="col-12">
					<p>“I've been playing football on and off since I turned five and I love to be involved in this beautiful game. I’m first and foremost a competitive FIFA Esports player from Sweden and I founded this organization as I saw the needs for a federation that started to take care about the governing around the Esport. In my view the E-football needed it most, so as I’m into FIFA Esport, it was a natural choice to develop this idea into IEFF.</p>

					<p>The foundation of IEFF were established before the FIFA Esports industry became integrated with the real football scene. And since, the time has come for IEFF to form the E-football scene in a sport-like direction and create a positive atmosphere for all involved. With IEFF we set the standards for the E-football in order to uphold it as a legitime and functional Esport. IEFF have taken the leads in showing the Esport scene how to organize an Esport.</p>

					<p>A large proportion of the people on planet earth can relate to football as the fans engagement of the sport can be seen through people’s identifying with their clubs and associations. All these unique attributes mimics the diversity of the world and shows us that all associations have an unique identity, with an own culture and history. Let us form the world of E-football in our own unique way, together we create the patterns that upholds IEFF and the E-football scene.” </p>


					<p>“With millions of daily players online, the worldwide E-football scene is a global Esport. The E-football is under IEFF approved as a sport, something that the competitive and developing aspects of the game makes clear. During competitive matches, decisions is taken in milliseconds and in order to make that small difference which takes you from loss to a win, a great increase of mental activity is needed. The E-football is also a certain type of athletic, which an increased heartbeat, sweaty hands and intense concentration is commonly known proofs of. The E-football have common similarities with its in real life opposite. Certain abilities such as different strategies, simulating and reading techniques shows us the common ground the both sports stand on. A revolution came to stake by the edition of FIFA 17, as the frostbite game-engine was introduced and the competitive scene have moved towards FIFA Ultimate Team. By the end of FIFA 16, players started to get signed by real football teams which have been the culminating stage for the E-football to come closer towards the real football.” </p>
